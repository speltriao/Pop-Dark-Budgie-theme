# Pop-Dark: Budgie theme

<p>How to use it: put https://github.com/speltriao/Pop-Dark-Budgie-theme/blob/main/gtk.css(gtk.css) file in /home/$USER/.config/gtk-3.0 . Save it, log and out and log in.</p> Done!

<p>It's heavily based on https://github.com/darkomarko42/Marwaita-Pop_os so I followed the GNU GPL3 license (as stated on .CSS file).</p>
